/// @notice This is an abstract contract to make it easy to build clients for
/// governance systems that inherit from GovernorCountingFractional, a.k.a.
/// "flexible voting" governors.
///
/// A "client" in this sense is a contract that:
///   (a) receives deposits of governance tokens from its users,
///   (b) gives said depositors the ability to express their voting preferences
///       on governance proposals, and
///   (c) casts votes on said proposals to flexible voting governors according
///       to the expressed preferences of its depositors.
///
/// This contract assumes that a child contract will implement a mechanism for
/// receiving and storing deposit balances, part (a). With that in place, this
/// contract supplies features (b) and (c).
///
/// A key concept here is that of a user's "raw balance". The raw balance is the
/// system's internal representation of a user's claim on the governance tokens
/// that it custodies. Since different systems might represent such claims in
/// different ways, this contract leaves the implementation of the `_rawBalance`
/// function to the child contract.
///
/// The simplest such representation would be to directly store the cumulative
/// balance of the governance token that the user has deposited. In such a
/// system, the amount that the user deposits is the amount that the user has
/// claim to. If the user has claim to 1e18 governance tokens, the internal
/// representation is just 1e18.
///
/// In many systems, however, the raw balance will not be equivalent to the
/// amount of governance tokens the user has claim to. In Aave, for example,
/// deposit amounts are scaled down by an ever-increasing index that represents
/// the cumulative amount of interest earned over the lifetime of deposits. The
/// "raw balance" of a user in Aave's case is this scaled down amount, since it
/// is the value that represents the user's claim on deposits. Thus for Aave, a
/// users's raw balance will always be less than the actual amount they have
/// claim to.
///
/// If the raw balance can be identified and defined for a system, and
/// `_rawBalance` can be implemented for it, then this contract will take care
/// of the rest.
